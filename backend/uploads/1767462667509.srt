1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How old are you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm 10.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm 10 too.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
When's your birthday?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
February 26th.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
March 17th.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm the youngest person in this class.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's funny.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, good. I see you two have met.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm younger than him.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How come you never mentioned she was coming to this class?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I thought it would be a fun surprise.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't like surprises.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why did why?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then why did you do it?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Some people like surprises.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I love surprises.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Did you enjoy this one?

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A 50% success rate. Not bad.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's get started.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not since sharing a uterus with my twin sister

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
have I been so unhappy sitting next to someone.
